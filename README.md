# Recipe App

This project is a **Recipe App** built using **Express**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **React.js**. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on recipes. It features user authentication and supports managing a collection of recipes with categories, images, and preparation details.

  - CRUD operations for recipes.
  - Validation of recipe data (e.g., required fields, valid IDs).

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: Bootstrap
- **Features**:
  - User-friendly interface for managing recipes.
  - Image upload via Cloudinary.
  - Dynamic routing with React Router.

### Recipe Management
